## Overview

This GitHub account is intentionally maintained with a **minimal and disciplined structure**.

I don’t optimize for visibility.  
I optimize for **engineering evidence**.

My learning model is simple:

> build → break → fix → understand


---

## Focus

- Learning through implementation, not tutorials
- Writing code that can run in production
- Turning incomplete ideas into working software

---

## Active Work

### Private Project
**API Traffic Anomaly Detection & Rate Monitoring System**  
Under active development.  
Will be made public after stability, baseline metrics, and documentation are complete.

### Learning Repository
**Next.js Fundamentals**  
Used for structured experimentation and controlled practice.

---

## Repository Principles

- No fake or inflated skill claims  
- No copy–paste tutorial projects  
- No abandoned repositories without explanation  
- Every public repository must be runnable  

---

## Engineering Philosophy

Execution > Planning  
Consistency > Motivation  
Progress > Perfection
